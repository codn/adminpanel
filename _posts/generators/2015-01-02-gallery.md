The command `rails generate adminpanel:gallery product` is going to create the files/migrations necessary for the gallery for `Adminpanel::Product`. After the command is run you'll have to:

*  Add the productfile to the form_field hash:

    ```
    {
      'productfiles' => {
        'type' => 'adminpanel_file_field',
        'label' => 'productfiles'
      }
    }
    ```

*  Add `mount_images :productfiles` to `adminpanel/product.rb`

*  Add `{ productfiles_attributes: [:id, :file, :_destroy] }` to the whitelisted attributes
