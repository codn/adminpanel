To create a resource just run the resource command, with

`rails g adminpanel:resource guitar description:wysiwyg price:float category:belongs_to release_date:datepicker`

of course, you can choose what parameters to send. The list of supported parameters is:

```
    field # no value given defaults to string
    field:string
    field:wysiwyg
    field:float
    field:integer
    field:boolean
    field:datepicker
    field:file # when a resource have a single attachment.
    category:has_many # when the resource you're creating has_many Adminpanel::Category
    category:belongs_to # when the resource you're creating belongs_to Adminpanel::Category
```

`field` is the name of the field that you want in the database. This will make the migration, create the necessary files with the necessary information, after this you should migrate the database, and restart your server and be able to enter "/adminpanel/yourmodel" to start creating records.

**Note**: Every resource needs an instance method called `name` even it's only

    def name
      return '' # you can generate the name from other attributes too.
    end
