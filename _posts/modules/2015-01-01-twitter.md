When including twitter, similar to facebook, you'll have to set your `twitter_api_key` and `twitter_api_secret` in your adminpanel setup, whitelist `:twitter_message` in the controller

And overwrite instance-method: `share_link` if isn't alredy

    def share_link
      Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.nintendo_url(self, host: 'www.rentadoraisla.com')
    end

Then, you're ready to go!

Make sure the application you're adding have:
* A website
* A callback url (although it's going to be ignored)
* Allows to login in the application (very important else a 401 unauthorized error will be raised)
