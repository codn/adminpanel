In order to use [friendly_id](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id), you need:

* Add a `slug` (string) field to the database.
* Add `include Adminpanel::Friendly` to your model.

If you need the slug to be generated with something different than name you may override
 `slug_candidates` instance method.

For deeper customization of the slug you may also add it to the `form_fields hash`.

To call a friendly model: `Adminpanel::Model.friendly.find(params[:id])`
