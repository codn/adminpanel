In order to use [friendly_id](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id), you need:

* Add a `slug` (string) to the attributes ( not necessary in `form_fields`, but recommended ).
* Add `include Adminpanel::Friendly` to your model.

You can override the default `slug_candidates` defining `slug_candidates` as an instance method with your custom candidates.
