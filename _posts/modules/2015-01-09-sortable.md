To let drag and drop to records of a model, on that model's index page (to add sort option to the model gallery see [SortableGallery]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url modules/2015-01-08-sortable-gallery %})).

You need to:

* Add `include Adminpanel::Sortable` concern in the model you want to make sortable.
* Add a `position`(integer) database attribute to that model.

After that, your model is going to come sorted every time when you search and you'll have icons to update the position of the model in the models index inside the panel.
