With this, the resource is going to have a facebook button to share the resource on facebook, you'll have to set  your `fb_app_id` and `fb_app_secret` in your configuration and have the fb app configured correctly (It need at leasst permissions to access user pages and to create posts).

You have to whitelist the params `fb_message`, and `fb_page_access_key` in your controller

And overwrite instance_method

    def share_link
      Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.posts_url(self, host: 'www.example.com')
    end

    # optional.
    # if this method return something different than nil,
    # it's going to be send as the thumbnail of the facebook post,
    # by default it returns nil and the image is choosen *randomly* by fb.
    def share_picture
      'http://example.com/image.png'
    end

That method should return the link that it's going to be shared.

Make sure your facebook application's configuration, under `Settings > Advanced` includes your host (development and production) url in the "Valid OAuth redirect URIs". For development `http://localhost:3000` etc...
