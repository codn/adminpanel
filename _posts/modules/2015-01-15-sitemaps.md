When included, it's going to add callbacks `after_create`, `after_destroy`, and `after_update` for the resource, and in the callback is going to ping google, bing and ask about the sitemap.

The sitemap should be in www.yourhost.com/sitemap.xml a common implementation of that [can be found here](https://gist.github.com/joseramonc/685aa22b81ec48235788).

It's also recommended that you add your sitemap location in `robots.txt` with: `Sitemap: http://example.com/sitemap_location.xml`
